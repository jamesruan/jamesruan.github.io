Our internet is becoming dangerous every day. 
\"The big brother is wathing you\" and more: they limit our freedom of information by filtering the internet by many means.

They use key words filtering to cut our tongue.\newline
They ues domain name pollution to blind our eye.\newline
They use CONNECTION RESET to kick us back to the IGNORANCE.\newline
They now use Machine Learning to pick up the Wall Tunneler and crash them like crashing a bug.

They have their enemies, but they kill millions people's freedom for one enemy.

It is not only the GFW, but also the technical guys behind that evil plan. They developed the weapon to make the internet a Winter of Nuclear, in the near future. We need our defence or all of us will not survive the Winter.

And we have to survive the Winter, and we need our tunnels for safety, not only to breach through the Wall but also a refuge to those who are not to be blinded, to be muted or to be fooled.

That is the initiative for this project. This project is just a pilot to experiment techniques and ideas. The final goal it to build a distributed trusted tunneling network that will be used whenever the freedom of information is at stake.
